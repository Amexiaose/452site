    <h1>My Self Introduction<h1>
    <p>My name is Sumail and I am studying in NBCC. My major is IT, which is my dream major in high school, because I watched the documentary about the development of IT in high school, in which I was deeply impressed by the rapid development of Internet technology.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my school web site. Everything you want to know about our school is in this web site.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage, where you will see a different me. My hobbies are reading books, playing basketball and occasionally playing video games. My plan for the future is to work in an Internet company as a programmer. This is my plan in recent years.</p>
