   <h2 > Sumailâ€˜s IT project:Large commercial database system</h2>


    <p>IT services :Large commercial database systemWhat I've mapped is a class of large database system models that can generate significant business value. The feature of this kind of database is that the data capacity is very large. One external schema can correspond to multiple applications, which determines which data applications can obtain from the schema, and improves the confidentiality of the database. There is a mapping between schema and schema that allows for database logical independence and allows the external schema to adjust without the need to adjust the application when the schema changes. There is a mapping between the schema and the internal schema to satisfy the database physical independence, and when the internal schema changes, the schema adjusts without the need to adjust the application.To extract truly valuable information from this massive data and transform the data into knowledge to support business decisions, data warehouses that can extract and store useful information to support decisions are neededCommercial data warehousing is not a new technology. It is a combination of BI, DW, OLAP, and DM. Commercial data warehouse technology is produced to solve the problem that enterprises or organizations with large amounts of business data can extract the information needed for operation and management decisions in a timely and effective manner. How to effectively organize large amounts of data, maintain the consistency of data, facilitate users' access, and provide convenience for decision-makers to effectively use commercial information? So that they can use the data warehouse system to make the right decision on enterprise management, so as to bring economic benefits to the enterprise.</p>
